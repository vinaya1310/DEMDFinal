# SentimentAnalysis
Twitter sentiment Analysis
I used twitter data to find out sentiment of any tweet! My model file is in "SentimentNew.ipynb".
Did not update the data file as it was too large for free github version.
I have added 3 pickle files(Sentiment-LR.pickle,Sentiment-BNB.pickle,Vectoriser-(ngram-1,2).pickle
I have used flask+swagger for creating the app end point
I have made a docker image and corresponding dockerfile and requirement file is updated.
Finally I have deployed my app on GCP and its working absolutely fine!

Here is the final link for deployed app on GCP
